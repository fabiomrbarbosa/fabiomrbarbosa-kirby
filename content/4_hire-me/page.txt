## What I do

For over 15 years I’ve been working with brands and people with a transformative vision to help them tell their story in their most authentic voice, and design immersive, accessible and engaging experiences.

I approach my work as a craft: I truly believe that a brand is only as strong as its set of values, that every message needs a purpose and that form definitely must follow function.

## My values

I’ve worked with clients in various sectors and markets, but my current focus is on sustainable, higher awareness projects that target structural change.

I hold myself to high standards, and thus I like to value my and your time. We’re more likely to be a match if your team or brand is agile while working from a base of solid research and strategy. I also prefer to work remotely, and have been doing so for nearly a decade.

If all this sounds good to you, let’s start a conversation. Just email me at: hello[at]fabiomrbarbosa[dot]com.
